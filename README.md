# TerraPiPy
Easy to use tools for terrarium/aquarium/vivarium control and **automation** for the Raspberry Pi written in Python and based on [pimatic](https://github.com/pimatic/pimatic).
TerraPiPy is short for "Terrarium + Raspberry Pi + Python". The core is written in Python and can be run on a Raspberry Pi to setup, monitor and **control** pilight to use many terrariums, aquariums and vivariums.

# TerraPiPy Web and TerraPiPy Info
Optionally [TerraPiPy Web](https://github.com/spech66/terrapipy-web) shows the data on a beautiful **website**. With [TerraPiPy Info](https://github.com/spech66/terrapipy-info) the data can be send to external systems like an Arduino.

# Features
TerraPiPy is the installation/maintenance/control part of the system. It helps to get pimatic running and monitors it to keep your pets happy.
* **Collect** sensor data (Temperature, humidity, weather, lights, ...)
* Multiple sensors and actuactors for every terrarium
* Control switches and other **actuators**
* Send **notifications** on warnings and errors (temperature to high, ...)
* **Log** all data

# Installation
Currently i work at high preasure to get this complete :smile:
