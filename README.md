# TerraPiPy
Easy to use terrarium/aquarium/vivarium control and **automation** for the Raspberry Pi written in Python. TerraPiPy is short for "Terrarium + Raspberry Pi + Python". The core is written in Python and can be run on a Raspberry Pi to **control** many terrariums, aquariums and vivariums.

# TerraPiPy Web and TerraPiPy Info
Optionally [TerraPiPy Web](https://github.com/spech66/terrapipy-web) shows the data on a **website** and allows configuration modification and manual interactions. With [TerraPiPy Info](https://github.com/spech66/terrapipy-info) the data can be send to external systems like an Arduino.

# Features
TerraPiPy is the control part of the system. Using intuitive config files all information are stored per terrarium.
* **Collect** sensor data (Temperature, humidity, weather, lights, ...)
* Multiple sensors and actuactors for every terrarium
* Control switches and other **actuators**
* Send **notifications** on warnings and errors (temperature to high, ...)
* **Log** all data

# Installation
Currently i work at high preasure to get this complete :smile:
